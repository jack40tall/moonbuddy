Moon Buddy

Moon Buddy is an app that lets you connect to a brokerage and select a stock-trading bot for your investmet strategy.
The stages of development are:

1. Develop a basic back end that allows you to register, create a basic bot for a single ticker, and run that bot analysis at regular intervals to notify you though websockets when to buy and sell.
2. Develop a basic front end that allows you to register, login, and create a basic bot.
3. Gain customer feedback
4. Iterate, pivoting and adding desired features (connect to brokerage, social aspect, trading-bot store)
